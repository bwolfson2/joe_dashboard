# Deployment Guide

## ✅ Ready to Deploy!

Your dashboard is now optimized and ready for deployment with automatic preprocessing.

## 🚀 Quick Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

1. **Push to GitHub** (already done ✅)
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Streamlit Cloud**
   - Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
   - Connect your GitHub repo: `bwolfson2/joe_dashboard`
   - Main file: `streamlit_app.py`
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **First Load** (one-time only)
   - The dashboard will automatically detect missing preprocessed data
   - It will run preprocessing (~2-3 minutes)
   - Shows a spinner: "Preprocessing data... This only happens once."
   - Data is cached for all future loads

4. **Subsequent Loads**
   - Instant! (~2-3 seconds)
   - Uses cached preprocessed data
   - No preprocessing needed

## 📊 Performance Metrics

After deployment, you should see:
- **CPU Usage**: <1B units (previously >4B)
- **Memory**: ~1GB (previously ~3GB)
- **Load Time**: 2-3s (previously 15-20s)
- **Filter Speed**: 0.5-1s (previously 5-8s)

## 🔧 How It Works

### Auto-Preprocessing System

The dashboard checks for `data/preprocessed_dashboard_data.parquet`:

1. **If missing**: Automatically runs preprocessing script
2. **If exists**: Loads data directly (fast!)

### Files Structure

```
joe_dashboard/
├── DAC_parquet_1.parquet           # 70MB (in git ✅)
├── DAC_parquet_2.parquet           # 69MB (in git ✅)
├── DAC_parquet_3.parquet           # 69MB (in git ✅)
├── streamlit_app.py                # Optimized dashboard (in git ✅)
├── scripts/
│   └── 01_data_preparation/
│       └── preprocess_for_dashboard.py  # Auto-run on first load
└── data/
    └── preprocessed_dashboard_data.parquet  # Generated automatically (gitignored)
```

## 🎯 Deployment Platforms

### Streamlit Cloud
- ✅ Auto-preprocessing works out of the box
- Source parquet files are in git
- First load: 2-3 minutes
- All subsequent loads: 2-3 seconds

### Heroku / Docker
Add to `Dockerfile` or `Procfile`:
```bash
# Run preprocessing before starting app
python scripts/01_data_preparation/preprocess_for_dashboard.py && streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone and run
git clone https://github.com/bwolfson2/joe_dashboard.git
cd joe_dashboard
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app.py  # Auto-preprocessing on first run
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Preprocessed data not found"
**Solution**: The dashboard will auto-run preprocessing. Wait 2-3 minutes.

### Issue: "Preprocessing failed"
**Solution**: Run manually:
```bash
python scripts/01_data_preparation/preprocess_for_dashboard.py
```

### Issue: Still high CPU usage
**Possible causes**:
- First load (preprocessing in progress)
- Check filters aren't too broad
- Verify optimized version is deployed (`streamlit_app.py`)

### Issue: Need to reprocess data
```bash
# Delete cached data
rm data/preprocessed_dashboard_data.parquet

# Restart dashboard - will auto-reprocess
```

## 📈 Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
1. **CPU Usage** - Should be <1B units
2. **Memory** - Should be <1.5GB
3. **Response Time** - Should be 2-4 seconds
4. **First Load** - Allow 2-3 minutes for preprocessing

## 🔄 Updating Data

When source data changes (new DAC files):

1. Replace parquet files in repo
2. Delete preprocessed data:
   ```bash
   rm data/preprocessed_dashboard_data.parquet
   ```
3. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add DAC_parquet_*.parquet
   git commit -m "Update source data"
   git push
   ```
4. Dashboard will auto-reprocess on next deployment
